# Project Progress: AI Hedge Fund

## Current Status Overview
- **Overall Project Health:** Green (Initial setup phase)
- **Current Branch:** `graceful-rate-limiting`
- **Primary Focus:** Establishing Memory Bank and preparing for graceful rate limiting implementation.

## What Works / Implemented Features
- **Memory Bank Core Files:**
    - `projectbrief.md` (Populated: 5/25/2025)
    - `productContext.md` (Populated: 5/25/2025)
    - `systemPatterns.md` (Populated: 5/25/2025)
    - `techContext.md` (Populated with details from README, pyproject.toml, package.json, Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml: 5/25/2025)
    - `activeContext.md` (Updated: 5/25/2025)
    - `progress.md` (This file, updated: 5/25/2025)
- Comprehensive initial population of Memory Bank files based on project configuration files (`README.md`, `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`) is complete.

## What's Next / In Progress / To Be Built
- **Immediate Next Actions:**
    1.  Implement graceful rate limiting in `src/tools/api.py` for `FinancialDatasets.ai` calls:
        - Added retry loops in `get_prices`, `get_financial_metrics`, and `search_line_items`.
        - Parsing `429` responses with the "Expected available in X seconds" message.
    2.  Write unit tests or simulate `429` responses to validate retry logic works correctly.
    3.  Monitor and adjust retry parameters (`max_retries`, backoff strategy) as needed.
- **Pending Tasks (Validation & Documentation):**
    - Create automated tests to simulate throttling scenarios.
    - Update user-facing documentation to mention built-in retry/backoff behavior.
    - Consider extending similar logic to other API endpoints if needed.

## Known Issues & Blockers
- **Information Gap:**
    - Actual implementation details of current API calls within `src/` are unknown.
    - Precise rate limit figures and desired handling strategies for each external API are still needed from the user or external documentation.
- No other known blockers at this initial stage.

## Progress Log
- **5/25/2025:**
    - Created initial set of Memory Bank files.
    - Read `ai-hedge-fund/README.md`, `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, `Dockerfile`, and `docker-compose.yml`.
    - Populated all core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) with information extracted from these configuration files.
    - Branch: `graceful-rate-limiting`
    - Objective: Establish project documentation structure and gather comprehensive initial project understanding from configuration files.

## Initial State
- This document was created on 5/25/2025.
- Current development focus: 'graceful-rate-limiting' branch.
